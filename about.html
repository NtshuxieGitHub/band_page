      <h2>About Westlife</h2>
      <p>
        Westlife are an Irish pop group formed in Dublin in 1998. The group
        consists of members Shane Filan, Mark Feehily, Kian Egan, and Nicky
        Byrne. Brian McFadden was a member before leaving in March 2004. The
        group disbanded in 2012 and later reunited in 2018. In Ireland, the
        group has 11 number-one albums, 16 number-one singles, and 34 Top 50
        singles. They have sold over 55 million records and are holders of four
        Guinness World Records.[1][2][3][4] Westlife has received numerous
        accolades including one World Music Award, two Brit Awards, four MTV
        Awards, and four Record of the Year Awards. The group has released
        twelve studio albums: four as a five-piece and eight as a four-piece.
        They rose to fame with their debut international self-titled studio
        album, Westlife (1999). It was followed by Coast to Coast (2000), World
        of Our Own (2001), and Turnaround (2003). Following the departure of
        McFadden, the group released the cover albums ...Allow Us to Be Frank
        (2004) and The Love Album (2006), the albums Face to Face (2005), Back
        Home (2007), Where We Are (2009), and Gravity (2010), followed by a
        six-year split. After reforming in 2018, the quartet released the studio
        albums Spectrum (2019) and Wild Dreams (2021).

        Kian Egan, Mark Feehily, and Shane Filan, all schoolmates at Summerhill
        College in Sligo, Ireland, participated in a school production of Grease
        with fellow Sligo men Derrick Lacey, Graham Keighron, and Michael
        Garrett. The sextet formed a pop vocal group called Six as One in 1997,
        later renamed IOYOU. The group, managed by choreographer Mary McDonagh
        and two other informal managers, released a single titled "Together Girl
        Forever" under Sound Records.[5] McDonagh first encountered Egan as a
        six-year-old student at her weekly dance classes and came to know Filan
        and Feehily in their early teens as they starred in shows such as
        Oliver! and Godspell for Sligo Fun Company.
